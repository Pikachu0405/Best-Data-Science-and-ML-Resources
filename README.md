Uber's Ludwig
Uber introduced a framework for training and testing deep learning models without the need to write code and named it Ludwig -
Ludwig is a toolbox built on top of TensorFlow that allows us to train and test deep learning models without the need to write code.
The core design principles of Ludwig are (source: Ludwig Github):
No coding required: no coding skills are required to train a model and use it for obtaining predictions.
Generality: a new data type-based approach to deep learning model design that makes the tool usable across many different use cases.
Flexibility: experienced users have extensive control over model building and training, while newcomers will find it easy to use.
Extensibility: easy to add new model architecture and new feature data types.
Interpretability and Understandability: Ludwig includes visualizations that help data scientists understand the performance of machine learning models.
